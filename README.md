Study Block

MyStudyPal enables you to divide long study hours into shorter periods.
Hence, you cannot read for more than two hours at a stretch, neither can you read for more than eight hours in a day.
By cultivating this effective study habit, you read more, assimilate faster, and command those A's easily! 


Accountability Pal/Buddy

We all need a buddy who can look out for us, and ensure that we stick to the right track. This is what MyStudyPal does for you.
While it can't speak to you, it can show you your study progress and give a report on how well/bad you have done. Isn’t that amazing?  
It does this by tracking your study progress and awards badges for consistency. 
The accountability pal that you have been looking for your whole life!
